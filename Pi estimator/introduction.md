This is a super smart way (though no efficient nor accurate) of
estimating ![here
pi](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cpi%24)
using geometry. Whenever we see ![here pi
again](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cpi%24),
we have to think on circles, so the key is to elaborate a relationship
between a circle and other geometric figure. This is
![def](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cpi%24)
definition:

#### *“The ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter.”*

Imagine a circle inscribed in a square. The relationship between their
areas is
![f1](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cfrac%7BA_%7Bcircle%7D%7D%7BA_%7Bsquare%7D%7D%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%20r%5E2%7D%7B4r%5E2%7D%24),
so we can isolate
![pi](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cpi%24)
as
![f2](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%244%5Cfrac%7BA_%7Bcircle%7D%7D%7BA_%7Bsquare%7D%7D%24).

Now that we have isolated
![pi](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cpi%24)
the next step is figure out how to compute it. Here is when a nice idea
comes to place:
